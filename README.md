# 🌿 Nature Landing Page

A fully responsive landing page project I built during my early days of learning frontend development — originally coded in April 2024, during my journey through the **Advanced CSS & Sass** course by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/).

This project holds a special place in my heart as it represents the first time I deeply understood CSS architecture, component design, BEM naming, and preprocessor tooling.

---

## ✨ Project Highlights

- 🔧 Built with `SCSS`, manually compiled using `node-sass`
- 🧱 Structured with a well-organized folder and component setup
- 🎯 Fully responsive and accessible
- 🧰 Utilizes tools like `autoprefixer`, `concat`, and `postcss-cli`
- 📄 No frontend frameworks – just pure HTML & CSS, as clean and lean as possible

---

## 🚀 Deployment

- ✅ Project runs locally at `http://127.0.0.1`
- 🔜 Soon to be deployed on **GitHub Pages**
- 🛠️ I plan to **rebuild this from scratch** using modern tools (like React + Tailwind) to showcase the progress I've made in one year.

## 🛠️ Build Process

The project uses a manual CSS toolchain (before I learned Webpack/Vite or Tailwind):

```bash
npm install        # Install all dev dependencies
npm run build:css  # Compile SCSS, concat, autoprefix, compress
